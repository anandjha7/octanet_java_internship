Short explanation of the ATM simulation program of Task 1 given by hashtag#octanet internship program.

ðŸš€ **ATM Machine Simulation in Java** ðŸ’»

I recently worked on an ATM machine simulation using Java to demonstrate basic banking functionalities. The program includes:

ðŸ”¹ **Balance Inquiry**: Check current account balance 
ðŸ”¹ **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw money while ensuring sufficient balance 
ðŸ”¹ **Cash Deposit**: Deposit money into the account 
ðŸ”¹ **PIN Change**: Update account PIN for security 
ðŸ”¹ **Transaction History**: Keep track of all transactions

The project leverages a simple menu-driven interface using a loop, allowing users to interact with the system and perform banking operations easily. It was a great way to practice core Java concepts like conditional statements, loops, and ArrayLists.




Short explanation of Task 2 - Build A Receipt Calculator In Java given by octanet internship.

ðŸš€ **Project: Receipt Calculator in Java** ðŸš€

I recently developed a Receipt Calculator in Java that helps manage items, calculate totals, apply discounts, and handle taxes. The key features include:

- Accepting input for items (name, price, quantity)
- Calculating subtotal, tax, and discounts
- Displaying the receipt with a detailed breakdown
- Saving the receipt as a text file for record-keeping

This project implements core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses Java collections like `ArrayList` to manage products. It was a great learning experience in handling file I/O operations and applying OOP concepts in a real-world scenario.

Looking forward to more exciting Java projects! ðŸ’»âœ¨
